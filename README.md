Learning Molecular Dynamics with Simple Language Model built upon Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network
This shows an example of how to use a simple LSTM based lagnuage model to learn a Langevin dynamics of a 4-state model potential introduced in [arxiv.org/abs/2004.12360](arxiv.org/abs/2004.12360). Please read and cite these manuscripts when using this example:

[arxiv.org/abs/2004.12360](arxiv.org/abs/2004.12360)

# LSTM_LM_4s.py 

This file contains all settings, data preprocessing, loss function, and the model itself. The program is tested under tensorflow/1.10.1 with keras beckend. Simpy implement this file by

`python3 LSTM_4s.py`

in the terminal. The program will save a file with prediction and corresponding training checkpoints of last few epochs.

# lossT.py

This program uses this file as input loss function.
For using other loss, removing line 179 and return in line 182:
`#--------------------------------------------------
from lossT import sparse_categorical_crossentropy

def loss(labels, logits):
    return sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, logits, from_logits=True)`
