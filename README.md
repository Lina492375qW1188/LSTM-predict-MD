Learning Molecular Dynamics with Simple Language Model built upon Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network
This shows an example of how to use a simple LSTM based lagnuage model to learn a Langevin dynamics of a 4-state model potential introduced in (arxiv.org/abs/2004.12360). Please read and cite these manuscripts when using this example:
